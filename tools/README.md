## Validating the history of the tor.rb formula

The extract_formula.sh script will copy the history of the tor.rb formula from the Homebrew repository.
Please feel free to examine and run the script and compare it with the history of the tor.rb file in this repository.

Because tor.rb was originally a part of Homebrew's main repository, and we are effectively forking that repository, I've included Homebrew's license into this repository as well.
As of this writing and of the time tor.rb was imported, Homebrew's license was the BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license.
