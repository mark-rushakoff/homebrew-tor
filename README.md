# Tor Homebrew Tap

This repository describes a [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) tap, or collection of formulae, for installing [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) from source.

## How do I use this repository?

First, make sure you have installed Homebrew.

Then run `brew tap TheTorProject/tor && brew install tor`.
